## Setup cemu-no-gyro

- Install cemuhook and Cemu. In the Cemu menu click on Options->GamePad motion source->DSU1->By Slot

- Tap any button on your controller and it will be auto-detected by cemu-no-gyro

- Load the game and adjust the game's motion control settings to your liking. For example if you just want to use motion controls in the shrines of Zelda BOTW, turn off motion control aiming in the game's settings.

- Keep this window open while playing and don't minimize it. You can use Cemu in fullscreen mode and input from your controller or phone will still be received by cemu-no-gyro.

- In BOTW you can keep cemu-no-gyro open in the background the whole time you play, not just during shrines. cemu-no-gyro will have no effect on the rest of the game.
